# Design Patterns in Python
This is an consolidated this space to write all the patterns described in the awesome book 'Head First Design Patterns' in Python.

I have gathered some good references of all the projects on Github and other places. You can find that in the 'references' folder.

The book is available to read [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1spxvFuaszSlT7Lm0mIOViINHzYqpDkaI).
